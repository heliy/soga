NAME
  **SOGA** - SOftware of Genome-wide Analysis for SNP Haplotype
DISCRIPTION
  A toolkit to caculate Linkage Disequilibrium and find haplotype block in SNP data.
PARAMETERS

    **-threads**,  the number of threads that SOGA uses in PHASE, **defualt 2**.

    **--full**,  to phase all SNPs.

    **--block**,  to find Haplotype Blocks, output as __OUTPUT__.BLOCK

    **--phase**,  to phase samples in blocks, output as __OUTPUT__.PHASED, MUST also have `--block`.

    **--cc**,  to do case-control test(include OR and  chi-square) in 1)SNP, in __OUTPUT__.CHECK, and, 2)haplotypes,  in __OUTPUT__.BLOCK; if you have `--block` and `--phase` in parameters, SOGA will do 1) and 2), otherwise, it just do 1).

    **--tag**,  to find tag SNP in blocks, output in __OUTPUT__.BLOCK, MUST also have `--block`

    **--GWHAS**,  do GWAS and GHWA

    **--snp-qc**,  QC results of SNPs, output as __OUTPUT__.SNPQC.

    **--filter**,  SNPs which PASS QC, output as __OUTPUT__.FILTER.

    **--baddata**,  SNPs which NOT PASS QC, output as __OUTPUT__.BADDATA.

    **--ld**,  to do LD caculation between two SNPs which distance is less than DISTANCE, output as __OUTPUT__.LD.

    **-ld-distance**,  MAX distance in calculate LDs in adjacent SNPs, **DEFAULT 1000**(bp).

    **-ht-window**,  the size of snps in one window while recongnizing haplotype blocks, **DEFAULT 200.**

    **-phase-window**,  the size of snps in one windo while phasing, **DEFAULT 2,000,000.**

    **--silence**,  running without asking confirmation

    **--help**,  print THIS help.

    **-snpfile**,  specifies the file of SNP data

    **-phasedfile,  specifies the PHASED file of SNP data

    **-sampleinfo**,  specifies the file of sample infomation

    **-filesplit**,  use delimiter instead of **defualt TAB** for process SNP file.

    **-output**,  specifies the files where to write the results.

    **-sample-nn**,  upper bound of ratio of nn genotype in one SAMPLE, **default 0.20**.

    **-snp-nn**,  upper bound of ratio of nn genotype in one SNP, **default 0.05**.

    **-maf**,  lower bound of MAF(Minor Allele Frequency), **default 0.01.**

    **-hwe**,  lower bound of HWE(Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium), **default 0.001.**

    **--ignoreGenotypeException**,  the SNP which have invalid genotype will be discarded silently.

    **-minHt**,  lower bound of ratio of haplotype when write haplotypes in __OUTPUT__.BLOCK file, **default 0.05**.

    **--cancel-check**,  do NOT check order in dataset.

    **--cancel-sample-qc**,  do NOT take quality control on samples
